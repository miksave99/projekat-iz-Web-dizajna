                            <b>The historical development</b> of Jošanička Banja as a settlement has always been linked to thermal springs. 
                            It is assumed that the Romans were first introduced to the healing waters of Jošanička Banja, and that their beneficial effects were also used by the Turks. 
                            The first professional examination of the medicinal properties of water was known only in 1834. 
                            The water was tested at the <i>Medical University of Vienna</i>, at the request of Prince Miloš. 
                            Jošanička Banja was visited by Josif Pančić in his many trips to Kopaonik, who says of it that it is <i>the hottest in Europe</i>.
                        </p>

                            Has 5 springs of mineral water, which are among the warmest in our country.

                            The waters of Jošanička Banja belong to the <i>hyperthermic group</i>, they contain: sodium, potassium, calcium, hydrocarbons, sulfates and fluorine. 
                            They are used for medicinal purposes by drinking and in combination with hydro-kinesis therapy and medications.
